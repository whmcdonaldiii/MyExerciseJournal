### A Simplified Prototype of a Potential Exercise Journal App

##### Somethings to note:

* The site is using LiteDB as a database. This is a local non-sequel database.
* The path for this database is "C:\Temp\ExerciseData.db" located in ExerciseRepository.cs
* Login and authentication is very simple...storing "credentials" in local storage.
